### Create blast database from fasta file

ViCAT can handle any custom database. This example uses the NCBI viral RefSeq sequences.

## Download

Go to viral [refseq](https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/release/viral/)

# Explanation for developers

This will include the NCBI RefSeq database to run the tool and provide an explanation on how to build a local blast database to include in this directory.

The files are currently too large to upload, so the LFS needs to be followed to upload the RefSeq database (https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/configuring-git-large-file-storage).
