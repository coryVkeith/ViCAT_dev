This will describe the test data and provide instructions for how to change the `config.sh` in the home directory.


`./sim_resist/` contains reads simulating a dataset consisting of 7 plants with differences in resistance to species of viruses by showing a reduction in the abundance of the reads associated with the virus of which the simulated plant is resistant. This directory also contains the profile information for each plant which is indicated by a decimal number relating to abundance as part of a whole (1). A fasta file including the raw sequences from which the reads were generated are included.
